    "text": "I was drifting through town, lost in thought, when I stepped into the street without looking. A piercing shriek sliced through the air—an old woman, her voice cracking like dead leaves, screamed for me to stop. I froze and turned just in time to see a bus thunder past, a blast of air clawing at my face. My heart pounded as I looked across to thank her, but the street was empty. No trace of her remained. That’s when the chill set in—she looked exactly like my grandmother, who we buried seven years ago. I still remember the floral scarf she wore... the same one we buried her in."

    "title": "The Pianist's Lament",
    "text": "We wandered into the skeleton of an abandoned theater, its air thick with forgotten breath. As we crept through its crumbling halls, a piano melody began to drift—low, haunting, almost mournful. It drew us to the stage, where a dust-veiled piano sat, keys untouched, strings long dead. Then he appeared: a tall, gaunt figure in tattered evening wear, standing in the balcony like a relic of grief. He stared down at us, his eyes hollow with memory, before dissolving into nothingness. Later, I learned of the fire—the pianist who perished mid-performance, still searching for his final ovation."

    "text": "The hotel was ancient, its walls whispering with age. At 2AM, I woke to the slow creak of footsteps across my room, soft and deliberate. I called out, but no answer came. I grappled with the light switch. As my eyes adjusted to the pale, sickly glow that spilled across the room, I noticed the rocking chair in the corner, moving to and fro as if someone had just risen from it. I watched it until it came to a dead, silent stop. In the gray light of dawn, I told the hotel owner. She gave me a knowing glance. 'That chair belonged to Edith. She lost her husband at sea and never left this room again. You’re not the first to feel her presence.'"

    "text": "In the cellar of the Treasurers House, the air turned ice-cold. From the stone wall, a muffled rhythm emerged—thump, thump, thump. Suddenly, a soldier emerged through the solid brick, followed by another. They were cut off at the knees, walking as if the floor level was three feet lower. Their armor was rusted, their faces weary with a thousand-year-old fatigue. They marched in a line, silent and indifferent to my presence, disappearing into the opposite wall. I later found out an old Roman road runs exactly three feet beneath that cellar floor."

    "text": "I was the only one on the night bus, or so I thought. I glanced at the dark window reflection and saw a man sitting directly behind me. He was wearing a heavy wool coat, but his face was obscured by a thick, oily shadow. When the bus passed under a streetlamp, his eyes flashed a brilliant, unnatural crimson. I spun around to confront him, but the seat was empty. The bus hadn't stopped. I looked back at the window—the reflection was still there, leaning closer to my neck, whispering a name I hadn't heard since childhood."

    "text": "They call it the most haunted village in England, and the woods didn't disappoint. My flashlight flickered and died as I reached the clearing. In the absolute darkness, the silence was shattered by a man's scream—raw, agonized, and coming from inches away. It wasn't a wind sound; it was the sound of someone dying. I felt a cold hand brush against my shoulder, pulling me toward the dense trees. I ran until my lungs burned, the screaming following me all the way to the edge of the village. I haven't slept without a light on since."

    "text": "The lighthouse has been automated for decades, but on stormy nights, a lantern still glows in the top gallery. I watched from the cliffside as a figure paced the narrow walkway, holding a swinging light. The figure stopped and pointed directly at a jagged rock formation in the bay. Five minutes later, a distress flare went up from that exact spot. When the lifeboat crew arrived, they found a fishing vessel taking on water. I asked about the watchman who signaled, but the crew just looked at each other. 'The last watchman died in 1922,' they said. 'He never stopped looking for ships in trouble.'"

    "text": "I had set the table for two, a lonely dinner to mark the day. As I poured the wine, the chair opposite me slid back with a loud scrape. A subtle scent of lilac—my late wife’s favorite perfume—filled the room. The air grew heavy, and a small indentation appeared on the seat cushion, as if someone had just sat down. I sat in stunned silence as the candle flame flickered toward the empty chair, dancing with an invisible breath. For one hour, the loneliness vanished, replaced by a warmth I thought I’d lost forever. When the lilac scent faded, the chair slid back into place."

    "text": "I was driving across the moor when the steering wheel suddenly jerked violently. I felt a pair of large, muscular, invisible hands clamp over mine, forcing the car toward the steep embankment. I fought with everything I had, screaming in terror as the car swerved back and forth. Just as the wheels touched the grass, the pressure vanished. I pulled over, trembling, and saw faint, bruised finger marks on the backs of my hands. Local legends speak of the 'Hairy Hands' that run drivers off the road here, but I never believed the stories until I felt their grip."

    "text": "During the low tide at Dead Man’s Cove, a strange sound rises from the sea caves. It’s not the crashing waves, but a chorus of deep, baritone voices singing an old Cornish hymn. I stood on the wet sand and watched as dozens of glowing shapes drifted out of the cave mouth, translucent and shimmering like jellyfish. They stood in the surf, their voices vibrating in my chest. They were the crew of the 'Siren', lost in 1890. As the tide began to turn, they walked back into the depths, their song fading into the roar of the ocean."

My reflection didn't move when I did. It stayed perfectly still, staring at me with a wide, unnatural grin that I wasn't making. I blinked, and the reflection reached out its hand as if to touch the glass from the inside. I smashed the mirror right then and there, but sometimes, when I walk past that empty spot on the wall, I still see a faint, smiling face in the shadows.",

Through the lens, I didn't just see a light; I saw a skeletal hand gripping the handle of a rusted iron lamp. The hand was dripping with seawater, and as I watched, a phantom ship—silent and torn to shreds—sailed right through the rocks where the light was waving. When I looked away for just a second to wipe the mist off my lens, both the light and the ship were gone, leaving only the sound of the freezing wind.",

As I turned a corner, I saw a figure in a toga, his face obscured by shadows, walking slowly toward the steaming waters. He paused, looked directly at me with hollow eyes, and then vanished into thin air. The next day, I learned that a Roman soldier had drowned in those very baths centuries ago, his body never recovered. Since then, I've felt an eerie presence whenever I visit that place.",
